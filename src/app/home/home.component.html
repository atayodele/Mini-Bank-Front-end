    <p>Google and Facebook buttons are available featuring each company's respective brand color. They are used on the user login and registration pages.

            You can create more custom buttons by adding a new color variable in the _variables.scss file and then using the Bootstrap button variant mixin to create a new style, as demonstrated in the _buttons.scss file.</p>
